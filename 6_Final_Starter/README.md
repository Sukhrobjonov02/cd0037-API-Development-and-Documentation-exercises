# The Treasure Library

This is practical project that I'd completed during studying Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree program, API Development and Documentation course. Users can add any books, delete them, modify them by title, author or ratings and search through book lists.
By doing this project I've learned and applied my skills structuring and implementing well formatted API endpoints that leverage knowledge of HTTP and (REST) API development best practices.

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisits and Local Development
You need to install [Python3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/), [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#installing-virtualenv), [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#installing-pip) and [node](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/) on your local machine to run this project.

#### Backend

First, [create virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) and [activate](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#activating-a-virtual-environment) it.
From the backend folder run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. All required packages are included in the requirements file.

To run the application run the following commands:
```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our app to use the `__init__.py` file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made. If running locally on Windows, look for the commands in the [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/factory/).

The app is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the forntend configuration.

#### Frontend

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client:
```
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start
```

By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000.

### Tests

In order to run tests, navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands:

```
dropdb bookshelf_test
createdb bookshelf_test
psql bookshelf_test < books.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command.

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality.

## API Reference

### Getting Started
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys. 

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable 

### Endpoints 
#### GET /books
- General:
    - Returns a list of book objects, success value, and total number of books
    - Results are paginated in groups of 8. Include a request argument to choose page number, starting from 1. 
- Sample: `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/books`
